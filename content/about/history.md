Less was created in 2009 by <a href="https://github.com/cloudhead">Alexis Sellier</a>, more commonly known as <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudhead">@cloudhead</a>. Originally written in Ruby, it was then ported to JavaScript.

Less was originally inspired by [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), with a leaner feature set and a syntax closely matching CSS, which Sass did not have at the time. (Sass was later inspired by Less to create SCSS, its own CSS-like syntax.)

In May 2012 Alexis turned over control and development to a core team of contributors who now manage, fix and extend the language.
